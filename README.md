# node-datastoreCRUD
Node CRUD example using Google Cloud Datastore

If you need help, call me:
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/thihenos), [Medium](https://medium.com/@thihenos)

### What I need ?

* SublimeText or other file editor
* NPM
* Node JS
* Express, node network app framework

### Very Important
You need to create your [Datastore](https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs/quickstart) database and [configure](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started) it. 
For me, the faster and easiest way to configure my Datastore base was following the steps which you download your Google Credentials in a JSON.

For better understanding, you MUST read [GoogleDatastore](https://github.com/googleapis/nodejs-datastore) github

### Installation

Download the project, and inside the main folder, just run the follow command for dependences installation

```sh
$ npm install
```

### Database
Follow the instructions on index.js file inside server folder to configure your Google Cloud Project.

### Test
In app.js file, I configurated the http PORT to 3000, you can change as you wanted, so, in this example, when start this example, it will be released in localhost:3000 address :)

So, open your favorite Terminal and run these command.
```sh
$ node app
```

You can check your app in localhost:3000/ ;)
